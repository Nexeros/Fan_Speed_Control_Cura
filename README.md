# Fan_Speed_Control_Cura
The Fan Speed Control plugin allows for gradual adjustment of the fan speed starting at a specific layer and ending at another layer. This allows for better cooling control and can improve the quality of your prints. The plugin can be found in the Cooling tab of the Print Settings and the settings can be saved with the profile.
