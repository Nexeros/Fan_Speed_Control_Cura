# Fan_Speed_Control_Cura
The Fan Speed Control script (maybe a plugin in the future) allows for gradual adjustment of the fan speed starting at a specific layer and ending at another layer. This allows for better cooling control and can improve the quality of your prints. The script can be found in the postprocessing tab.
#Installation
To use FanSpeedControl.py, copy it into the scripts folder located at AppData\Roaming\cura\{your cura version}. 
To access the AppData\Roaming folder, you can paste %AppData% into the file explorer.
